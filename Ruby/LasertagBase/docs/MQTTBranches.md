# MQTT Branch setup description

## Weapon Branches
The weapons are the main unit of the Lasertag system. As such, they use a specific
branch setup to minimize traffic to them, while making code maintaining easier.

The basic branch setup is:
> Lasertag/Players/**ID**/**Keys...**

- **ID** is the MAC of the Player, allowing unique identification of
	each set out of the box.
- **Key** is a one- or two-layer key of the attribute to change.
	Attributes are grouped, making it easier to subscribe to one group of attributes
	without having to worry about the others.

In the following, the different groups of keys will be outlined, followed by
a description of each attribute per group.
